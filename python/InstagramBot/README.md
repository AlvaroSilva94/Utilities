# Lost the game

The game is the most silly thing on the internet and it simply is: if you remeber the game, you lose the game. There is no win, for anyone.
My friends used to send the message "Lost the game" to a group chat daily. As a way to challenge myself and to defeate them at their own game (no pun intended), I decided to automate their precious task and created this instagram bot that automatically sends that message every 30min to the group chat.
